# PlantCV Transformation config â€” robust defaults
# This file makes the CLI deterministic and tunable without touching the code.
# You can adjust thresholds here for different species, lighting, and backgrounds.

# --- General ---
# Gaussian blur sigma used in the Blur step (fallback)
gaussian_sigma: 1.5

# ROI output size (H, W)
roi_size: [256, 256]

# Total number of pseudo-landmarks to place (border/veins/anomalies balanced)
landmarks_count: 80

# --- Masking (segmentation) ---
# Strategy: auto | hsv_s | hsv_v_dark | hsv_h | lab | kmeans
# Changed to hsv_h for better color-based leaf detection
mask_strategy: hsv_h

# Background bias helps k-means pick the correct cluster:
#   light_bg for bright backgrounds, dark_bg for dark backgrounds, or leave null
bg_bias: light_bg

# Refine the best mask with GrabCut (2 iterations) for better edge refinement
grabcut_refine: true

# Extended hue range for diseased leaves (yellow, brown, red spots)
# Covers green healthy leaves + diseased variations
green_hue_range: [15, 110]

# Relaxed object size bounds for better leaf capture
# Allows smaller diseased areas and larger leaf+stem combinations
min_object_area_ratio: 0.15
max_object_area_ratio: 0.85

# Increased fill size for diseased leaves with holes/spots
fill_size: 800

# Larger morphological kernel for better leaf boundary cleaning
morph_kernel: 5

# Enhanced upscaling for better edge detection on small images
mask_upscale_factor: 1.2
mask_upscale_long_side: 1400

# --- Shadow suppression ---
# Remove low-V, low-S, non-green pixels from the mask candidate and re-score
shadow_suppression: true

# Max saturation to consider a pixel as shadow when V is low
shadow_s_max: 45

# How to pick the V threshold: otsu | percentile
shadow_v_method: otsu
shadow_v_percentile: 35  # Improved threshold for better shadow handling

# Additional shadow removal parameters for better detection
